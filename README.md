👋 Hi, I'm Mitxel Sulca!

I’m an enthusiastic junior Cloud & DevOps enthusiast, actively building my skills in Kubernetes, Terraform, and infrastructure automation. My goal is to become a skilled Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) — someone who helps companies improve reliability and automate processes to make their systems run smoothly and safely.

Though I’m still growing professionally, I bring solid experience in technical support, system administration, and working with tools like Linux, Docker, Bash scripting, PHP, Python, Prometheus, Grafana, and more. I love learning on my own and taking on new challenges that push me to grow faster.

I’m a fast learner, self-motivated, and enjoy collaborating with others. Having worked directly with users, I value clear communication and teamwork, and I thrive adapting to new environments and technologies — because that means I’m constantly growing, and that excites me.

While I’m open to any work setup, I’d love to eventually work remotely, even if part-time.

When I’m not diving into cloud or DevOps, I also enjoy programming and experimenting with new languages — it’s a fun way to keep sharpening my skills.

Feel free to connect if you want to chat about Cloud, DevOps, or just tech in general!
